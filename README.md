#To-Do list App
Everyday there are certain number of tasks that a person needs to complete. Keeping all the
tasks in memory is not an efficient way of managing what tasks has been done and what are we left
to-do. A to-do list application is an organized way of managing the list of tasks a user
needs to complete. It also provides a clear outline of the tasks that have been completed
and what's left to be done. As you go through your tasks one by one, and cross it off the list,
it will provide you with a sense of accomplishment. It can also help an user prioritize which 
tasks are more important then others.

This application is intended for anyone who needs to manager their daily activities in an
efficient and organized manner.

I am interested in this project, because it will help me in applying my skills acquired
in class. I will be able to use my own application when keeping track of the list of tasks that
I need to finish, instead of using a third party application. Also as I understand concepts
more firmly, I can make better changes to my application. More advanced features will be added in future.
